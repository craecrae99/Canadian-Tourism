<td  style=color:red;"> The Rideau Canal is a very popular attraction during the winter. It was made in Ottawa to transport ships throughout Southern Ontario and nowadys during the winter it's a popular attraction for people to skate on it as it's the largest ice rink in the world. It cuts the city almost in half and it is nice just to walk along during the summer, but if you decide to go during the winter I would recommend you bring some warm clothing as it can be really cold.</td>

<td  style=color:red;"> Kluane National Park is a beautiful park in the northern Canadian territory, Yukon. Yukon is in the North-West of the country. As Yukon is in the North most people travel there in the summer to enjoy the warm weather and the hiking for the incredible views. If you were to go in the winter it would be very hard to hike around and the views would not be as good because of the layer of snow.</td>
